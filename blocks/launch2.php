				<p>We believe that regardless of how capable a single individual or how great a single idea, true impact is only realized when you are able to tell a compelling story, foster strong relationships, and bring people along with you. We work to listen deeply, understand others’ needs and preferences, and tell a story that meets our audience where they are rather than expecting them to be where we are.</p>
