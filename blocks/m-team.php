                <div> I studied political science and international relations at UBC because my parents always wanted me to become a politician. The most important thing I learned is that political science does not prepare you for a career in Politics. It does, however, gives you access to an experience as broad and deep as you choose to make it. In the course of my degree, I studied in Grenoble, France, where I received a certificate of political studies, served as the vice-president of OXFAM UBC, helped to manage the university's International Peer Program, and co-founded&nbsp;the Africa Canada Accountability Coalition (ACAC) research and advocacy initiative. ACAC has since been nominated for the YMCA Power of Peace award in 2010 and the MacJannet Prize for Global Citizenship from Tufts University in 2011. Since leaving university, I have interned&nbsp;for the Vancouver Organizing Committee for the 2010 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games&nbsp;and facilitated a Learning Circle on the Great Lakes Region of Africa for international development organizations based in BC working in the GLR. I now work in Toronto for the Canadian Merit Scholarship Foundation. </div>

                <div><p>My story is one of multiple dichotomies - though intentional ones, I like to think. I have a deep numbers past -somehow I'm a Chartered Accountant - while recently I've been pondering the fascinating intersection of people and organizations - fancy relevant terms include: organizational development, leadership development, change management, facilitation, human systems / interactions. My days are deep in the business sector while my nights and weekends are deep in social sector on a mission to shake up the system and get to know myself a ton more along the way.</p>
<p>Somehow and at some point, I was the only Canuck to have a repeat perfect score on the American Math Competition, managed to find $70K which let me use my 5yrs at university to mostly design ingenious pranks, led the transformation of student representation in my faculty, landed a gig as an Adjunct Faculty to brainwash 100 very impressionable kids with my musings, and decided to pack up life and move to Barbados.</p>
<p>The only three things I need in life are Food. Sleep. Sports. (bribery hints) though there is plenty more I want. I will debate you on almost any topic of public policy, will participate for free in any wit+sarcasm battle (though I charge to facilitate conversations), and will be the force of good in the world for acting more like kids cuz dey d only ones who got it right.</p>
<p>All right then.</p></div>

                <div><p>I spent most of my childhood growing up at one nerd camp after another, lesson-hopping 7-days a week, and joining kid's loyalty clubs offered by airlines. I loved speaking with strangers and learning intimate details about their lives - it didn't even matter if it was in English or Chinese! People still share stories with me nowadays, which is awesome.</p>
<p>In high school, I seemingly joined every club, apparently knew "everyone," and somehow managed to play sports too. (Marksmanship counts!) In my "free time," I put my ARCT Piano Performer's Diploma to good use and learned how to fly a Cessna. Who knew all that would double my CAS hours for an International Baccalaureate Diploma and allow me to get my Bachelor of Commerce degree "free-of-charge!" The coolest of all: making an acceptance speech at the YWCA Women of Distinction Awards and having my trips funded to work and volunteer in both Hong Kong and Malaysia.</p>
<p>Nowadays, I enjoy city-hopping, facilitating leadership conferences, and reading the latest technology trends (whilst thumbing my BlackBerry!) I also like writing essays for fun on my blog and apparently have a strong online presence, living the #tywlife.</p>
<p>Let's be tweeps! Lots of #MLove, @tammyYTwong</p></div>

                <div><p>Like many ambitious five-year olds, I grew up thinking I would go to medical school and become a doctor. Since then, I've definitely come a long way from my initial ambitions. </p>
<p>I developed an immediate passion for social justice in elementary school when I began fundraising for causes I felt were important. At that time, this basically just involved my eight year old self going door-to-door in my neighbourhood collecting donations! Since then I have invested a great deal of my time in peer mentoring and fostering a new generation of leaders as well as advocating for various humanitarian issues. I have had the privilege of serving as a youth representative to senior levels of Canadian government as well as the United Nations. At the moment, I serve as a member of the National Young Adult Leadership Team with Health Canada and am in the midst of designing a microcredit program for local female entrepreneurs in Tanzania with Queen's University Medical School. I currently study Economics and Psychology at the University of Toronto. </p>
<p>When I'm not focused on school and other responsibilities I enjoy tweeting, baking, and making memories with my friends.

                <div><p>Being involved in my community and forging meaningful relationships has always been important to me. As a kid, it meant doing parks & rec classes and joining every club in school. In university, I focused my energies towards causes that mattered to me - human rights, education, service, sustainability. I got involved on and off campus through Residence Life, Amnesty International, and Academic advocacy for Science students.</p>

<p>With a friend - I used my love for independent music as inspiration to create handmade jewellery to raise money for volunteer abroad projects. I traveled to Cuernavaca, Mexico for a service-learning project - working on a housing project & engaging in educational workshops. We now import handmade bags and coin purses from an Artisan's Co-operative I met in Cuernavaca, in support of the fair trade movement.</p>

<p>I currently study Biology & Pharmacology with an interest in social pharmacology and healthcare & I look forward to a lifetime of learning. Through my academic program I have lived and worked in Toronto, Saskatoon, and Montreal, Canada. Outside of my full time work, I volunteered, learned new crafts, and made incredible connections in cities away from home. When I'm not immersed in work, I love learning languages (working on French and Tamil at the moment), live music, cooking, and community. :)</p>

                <div><p>A thirst for life has been the driving force in the winding path my past
has taken. From an early age, curiosity around my purpose in the world
forced me to seek out experiences that gave me a sense of fulfillment. I
soon found this in things like community and the act of creation.
Consequentially, my teenage years were a complete immersion in every type
of group and initiative that I could get my hands on.</p>

<p>After graduating from High school, I took a year to travel in South
America. Living in community, I spent a lot of time reflecting on the
nuances of my life. A deep appreciation of the subjective nature of my
experience was the starting point for a period of immense self discovery.
This growth in self awareness was supported by daily practices of
meditation and an exposure to the concept of mindfulness. I started
learning to accept my failures and to embrace my vulnerabilities. It was
around this time that I first learned about and started engaging with the
M-Network.</p>

<p>Nearly a year later, I am now helping to catalyze our National Hub Program.
I stick around because the Network provides me with the elements I have
always been looking for; Community. Creativity. Contribution to the world
around me. Discovery and wonder. The opportunity for learning and growth. A
feeling of being alive - A feeling of being fulfilled.</p></div>
