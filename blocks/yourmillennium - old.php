<h1>"Millennium Changed My Life"</h1>
<p><strong><abbr title="(those of you I haven't met yet and those of you who have turned into a mix of my inspirations, my heroes, my best friends, and my most memorable 2:30AM conversations)">Laureates,</abbr></strong></p>
<p>At the turn of the new millennium, a decision was made to invest into something big - the Canada Millennium Scholarship Foundation.</p>

<p>One part of the Foundation was the Excellence Awards Program - and wow, was it worlds more than a Program and was it certainly more than just an Award!</p>

<p>It was a national experiment in transforming Canada's future through investing in great people, bringing them together, and giving them opportunities to dream, learn, and share. From the Awards to the Chapters to the Conferences to the Grants, we can only marvel at things we all learned.</p>

</p>
<p>There is a whole book on the details of what the Foundation did <a href="http://www.dmpibooks.com/book/a-million-futures" target="_blank">(check out Silver Donald Cameron&rsquo;s great work, A Million Futures)</a> during its 10 years in existence but there is something many of us felt and expressed time after time. It changed our views, our beliefs, our paths, and our ways of dealing with the world.<br />
  <br />
  In short, many of us felt that Millennium - nay, the people of Millennium - <strong>changed our lives</strong>.<br />
  <br />
  On his last day at the Foundation before it closed, <strong>Chad Lubelsky</strong>, a Foundation stalwart and the catalyst behind much of the awesomeness that happened, wrote these words in a note borrowing with gratitude and apology from Boston the band:<br />
  <br />
  <em>I looked out this morning and the sun was gone<br />
  Turned on some music to start my day<br />
  I lost myself in a familiar song<br />
  I closed my eyes and I slipped away<br />
  <br />
  It's more than a feeling<br />
  (More than a feeling)<br />
  When I hear that old song they used to play<br />
  (More than a feeling)<br />
  I begin dreaming<br />
  (More than a feeling)<br />
  'Til I see Millennium walk away<br />
  I see my Millennium walkin' away</em><br />
  <br />
  It definitely was more than a feeling - but we think Millennium only walked away for a sabbatical and<strong> it&rsquo;s time to really bring the amazing back!</strong><br />
  <br />
  It&rsquo;s high time we bring back what we loved about it, reconnect as a community, and share it with other emerging leaders across the country<br />
  <br /></p>
  <h3>You have told us what you loved about Millennium was the people, the connections, the support, the resources, the people, and the connections.</h3>
  <p>We listened; and in 2012, you can expect a lot more of just what you loved:</p>
  <h4>M-Jams</h4>
  <p>On the last Saturday of every month, from the comfort of your PJs, an M-Jam gives you the opportunity to reconnect with old friends and meet new like-minded people from across the country, laugh together, learn from one another, and share stories!</p>
  <h4>Local Hubs</h4>
  <p>It's where the magic happens - connecting with incredible people around great food and in a comfortable space...from social events to community projects, this is where M becomes real in your home community</p>
  <h4>Conferences</h4>
  <p>10x the connections, 100x the magic, 1000x the spontaneous late-night conversations. There isn't anything like it.</p>
  <h3>You also told us that we should also work to provide the same experiences and opportunities for other emerging leaders in Canada - so we are introducing...</h3>
  <h4>M-Awards</h4>
  <p>A national award that recognizes and connects our country's emerging leaders and supports them as they create the extraordinary </p>
  <h3>How will we accomplish it all?</h3>
<p>It's already happening:<br/>

<p>WE CAN'T DO IT WITHOUT YOU:<br/><a href="join.php#opportunities" target="_blank"><img src="./images/jointeam.png" /></a></p>

<p>Of course, we also need money to make our big vision a reality - we've done a scan of over 500 granting organizations and individuals in Canada and abroad and will be embarking on a series of conversations with potential funders over the next few months.</p>

<h4>Let's make M the home of Canada's emerging leaders. Together.</h4>
